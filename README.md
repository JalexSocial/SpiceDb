SpiceDb is an open-source, Zanzibar-inspired authorization system that provides a robust and scalable solution for managing fine-grained permissions across distributed systems. Its implementation closely follows the principles set out in Google’s Zanzibar paper, adapting them into a practical and deployable system.

SpiceDb was created by [AuthZed](https://authzed.com/) and [documentation](https://authzed.com/docs/spicedb/getting-started/discovering-spicedb) specifically for SpiceDb can be found on their site.

## SpiceDb.net Documentation 
SpiceDb.net was created by Michael Tanczos and has contributions from Pavel Akimov, Mahesh Bailwal, Vinícius Gajo, and others.  Documentation for SpiceDb.net is in progress and can be found here:
[https://jalexsocial.github.io/spicedb.docs/](https://jalexsocial.github.io/spicedb.docs/)

## What's New?

1.5.2
- BREAKING CHANGE: ReadRelationships now accepts a SubjectFilter (thanks to @epbensimpson)  for the second parameter along with an optional relationship limit and cursor
- BREAKING CHANGE: DeleteRelationshipsAsync utilizes an optional SubjectFilter (thanks to @epbensimpson) instead of a RelationshipFilter
- BREAKING CHANGE: DeleteRelationshipsAsync returns a DeleteRelationshipsResponse object with the ZedToken and deletion progress instead of just the ZedToken

1.5.1 
- @nexthash added caveat handling for relationship creation
- added WriteSchemaAsync method to client
- added additional unit tests

## Usage

### Install

Available on Nuget at https://www.nuget.org/packages/SpiceDb

Install the package using NuGet  
`Install-Package SpiceDb`


Example Using UserSecrets

```csharp

using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using SpiceDb.Example;
using SpiceDb.Example.MyObjects;
using SpiceDb.Models;

// This is just to keep the server address and token private
var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
    .AddUserSecrets(typeof(Secrets).Assembly)
    .AddEnvironmentVariables();
var configurationRoot = builder.Build();

var secrets = configurationRoot.GetSection("AuthZed").Get<Secrets>();

if (secrets is null)
    throw new ArgumentException("Invalid secrets configuration");

// var serverAddress = "https://grpc.authzed.com";
// Create a new client with a prefix of "arch" for all defined objects
var client = new SpiceDbClient(secrets.ServerAddress, secrets.Token, "arch");

// Add relationship where user:bob is a reader of document:firstdoc
// Note that because the schema prefix is set in the client it is not necessary to always prefix every resource definition 
client.AddRelationship("arch/document:firstdoc#reader@arch/user:bob");

// This also works
client.AddRelationship("document:firstdoc#reader@user:kevin");

// Second approach to adding relationships
client.AddRelationship(new Relationship("arch/document:firstdoc", "reader", "arch/user:jacob"));

// This approach uses a little syntactic sugar to define each of the relations
client.AddRelationship(ZedUser.WithId("carmella").CanRead(ZedDocument.WithId("firstdoc")));

// Check to see if user:bob is in fact now a reader of document:firstdoc
var bobCanRead = client.CheckPermission(new Permission("arch/document:firstdoc#reader@arch/user:bob"));

Console.WriteLine($"Can user bob read document:firstdoc? {bobCanRead.HasPermission}");
// true

// This is a similar check but without adding prefixes
var kevinCanRead = client.CheckPermission(new Permission("document:firstdoc#reader@user:bob"));

Console.WriteLine($"Can user kevin read document:firstdoc? {kevinCanRead.HasPermission}");
// true


// Check to see if user:carmella is in fact now a reader of document:firstdoc
var carmellaCanRead = client.CheckPermission(ZedUser.WithId("carmella").CanRead(ZedDocument.WithId("firstdoc")));

Console.WriteLine($"Can user carmella read document:firstdoc? {carmellaCanRead.HasPermission}");
// true


```
